# Summer-Project
# Geofencing against Outliers 
# This project aims to detect outliers on a user generated 2D dataset.
# It first uses Distance based methods available under SciPy Python Library
# to calculate the distances. 
# Further, it uses 2 geofencing algorithms - Ray casting and Winding number to do the same.
# It compares the time Time complexity of both both the methods - Distance based and geofencing algorithms
# and proves that geofencing algorithms are more efficient than distance based methods to detect outliers.
